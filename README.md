(GNU Radio 2020 Workshop presentation can be viewed here:  https://youtu.be/0hnWfTvETcU)

Phased array beamformers are very powerful! And they find applications in 5G MIMO, FMCW radar, and satellite communications. But their underlying principles and issues can be hard to intuitively grasp. But with the instructions and explanations here, you can build an easy to use system that allows you to experience the underlying math and principles of beamformers.  With this setup, you'll track an RF source, plot its beam characteristics and learn of the features integrated into modern beamformer ICs. It is a hands-on way to learn about steering angle, beam width, null locations, beam tapering, grating lobes, and beam squint.  


To get started, first read the "Phased Array Lab Build Your Own" document.  Then peruse the "Phased Array Lab" document to see what we'll be learning.  After that, please try it out and build your own.  Seeing and manipulating the beam first hand is much more informative and educational then just seeing the equations or the slides I provide of what the beam should look like.  Build it, play with it, and you'll learn a ton about this very powerful concept.
